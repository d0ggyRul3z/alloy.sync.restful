alloy.sync.restful
==================

This aims to be the straight port of the default Backbone.js (restful) sync adapter for Appcelerator Titanium Alloy. (Meaning the restful adapter that comes with Backbone.js out-of-the-box but for Alloy. The code is taken and modified directly from http://docs.appcelerator.com/backbone/0.9.2/docs/backbone.html#section-162)
